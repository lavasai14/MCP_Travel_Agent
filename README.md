MCP Travel System Without Agents:
The server exposes hardcoded tools—like get_weather, get_flight_details, and generate_itinerary_pdf—which return mock data or generate a PDF itinerary. The client explicitly calls each tool sequentially, providing parameters in code. All queries and tool usage are fixed, and the system has no autonomous decision-making. Communication is asynchronous via MCP over standard I/O, but the flow is entirely controlled by the client.

MCP Travel System Using Agents:
An agent-based setup uses an MCP agent to orchestrate multiple tools dynamically. The agent can decide which tools to call, in what order, and with which parameters, based on user input or context. For example, a user could ask for a full travel plan, and the agent would fetch weather, flights, and generate an itinerary automatically. This approach allows flexible, autonomous workflows rather than hardcoded calls, while still using MCP for communication between tools and the agent.
